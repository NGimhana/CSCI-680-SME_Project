Bug 1214 - Confirmation field doesn't react to "show password" option when setting password/PIN the first time #### General information

* **App version:** master
* **App source:** GitHub

#### Steps to reproduce
1. Open a fresh installation of the app.
1. Choose Password/PIN as encryption method.
1. Enter something into the "Enter new password" and "Confirm password" fields.
1. Tap the visibility icon to show password/PIN.

#### Expected result
**What is expected?** 
When the visibility icon is tapped to show the password/PIN, the confirm field should also show the password/PIN.
